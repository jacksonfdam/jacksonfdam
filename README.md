### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! I'm Jackson! I often describe myself as a tech lead developer, with comprehensive knowledge in web and mobile development.

Since 1998 I have worked with websites and web applications, however, in 2009 I improved my career with mobile development skills.

As a mobile developer, I have been collaborating with developers' communities as well.

I love new challenges and learning new technologies or languages is part of my core.

I live in Porto Alegre, Brazil with my family (my wife and two daughters), and I would really enjoy a friendly working team and a workflow that planning and use case approach are welcome as problem-solving methods. And a fair payment would be much appreciated!
